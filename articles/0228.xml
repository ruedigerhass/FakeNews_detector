    <mainText>If there&#226;&#128;&#153;s anyone in this day and age who most definitely doesn&#226;&#128;&#153;t mince words, and will say what needs to be said, it&#226;&#128;&#153;s Vice President Joe Biden. While speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on a campaign stop for Hillary Clinton, Biden tore into some of the remarks from Monday&#226;&#128;&#153;s debate. Especially when Donald Trump seemed to think it&#226;&#128;&#153;s perfectly fine to screw over the American people, or benefit from their sorrow. Biden said: &#226;&#128;&#156;This is a guy who said &#226;&#128;&#148; and wants to be president &#226;&#128;&#148; that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?&#226;&#128;&#157; Adding: &#226;&#128;&#156;Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we&#226;&#128;&#153;re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are.&#226;&#128;&#157; Then really getting to the core of it, he said: &#226;&#128;&#156;He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have. They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don&#226;&#128;&#153;t take pleasure from &#226;&#128;&#152;You&#226;&#128;&#153;re fired.&#226;&#128;&#153; They don&#226;&#128;&#153;t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit.&#226;&#128;&#157; Biden also talked about how Trump seems proud of not paying taxes. Taxes that all of us have to pay and don&#226;&#128;&#153;t have the luxury of manipulating the tax code to our advantage. &#226;&#128;&#156;He acknowledged that he didn&#226;&#128;&#153;t pay taxes because, he said, he&#226;&#128;&#153;s smart. Makes him smart. Tell that to the janitor in here who&#226;&#128;&#153;s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.&#226;&#128;&#157; Biden knows, as we should all know by this point in the election, who the better choice is for Commander-in-Chief. He reiterates: &#226;&#128;&#156;If this choice isn&#226;&#128;&#153;t clear, I don&#226;&#128;&#153;t know &#226;&#128;&#147;- my lord&#226;&#128;&#166; What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.&#226;&#128;&#157; And it&#226;&#128;&#153;s true, the choice is abundantly clear &#226;&#128;&#148; Hillary Rodham Clinton should and be our next president.

    <mainText>Hillary Clinton&#8217;s optics don&#8217;t get much worse than this&#8230; unless of course she has seizures, her knees buckle and she&#8217;s lifted/dragged into a van &#8211; all in front of the media and on 9/11. At Temple University, which has 38,000 students, Clinton had a rally&#8230; one that probably held less than 200 attendees. If you go to her site, it says the event reached capacity. What a spin. It also looked to me like there were about as many in the press there as there were students. Just pathetic. As you can see below, a Trump rally draws thousands and is packed. And it&#8217;s not just the attendance. Clinton had to climb all of four stairs to get to the podium and exit the stage. In the pic below, you see a man having to help her as if she is elderly and bordering on being an invalid. Not exactly the picture of health or a strong leader to say the least. Wonder if Vegas is taking bets on her life expectancy.  From Top Right News: Hillary Clinton traveled to Temple University on Monday to woo millennial voters. Nearly 38,000&#160;students are enrolled at Temple. Yet&#160;Hillary had a hard time filling up the small room&#8230; Hillary also has a hard time getting up the stairs to the platform.&#160;She then&#160;needed help&#160;just to make it up a small flight of 4 steps leaving the area. Democrats were horrified as photos of grandma Clinton were released by Getty: PHILADELPHIA, PA &#8211; SEPTEMBER 19: Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is helped up stairs after delivering a millennial speech at Temple University on September 19, 2016 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Hillary Clinton is campaigning in Pennslyvania. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Between the shoe closet rallies, lack of interest and obvious health issues&#8230; the Hildabeast is in real trouble here. Her ground game right now sucks&#8230; in Delaware, Ohio with a population of over 2 million, no one showed for a door knocking event. Add to that disclosures on Reddit that her go-to IT guy and Clinton were looking for ways to cover her tracks on emails and you have a political nuclear bomb. But there&#8217;s more! WikiLeaks is about to dump info. on Clinton smuggling weapons in Benghazi to al Qaeda. Something Glenn Beck predicted from the beginning. That scandal is getting ready to re-explode. With all of this, one of several things could happen&#8230; she could lose in a landslide to Trump, which is looking more and more likely&#8230; Clinton could drop dead before the election or she could get impeached right after being elected. Not good. The Democrats made a massive mistake in not going with someone else. They are scared stiff and should be.    </mainText>

    <mainText>Donald Trump&#8217;s lies are catching up to him one by one, and the latest person to call him out is&#160;Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and biographer David Cay Johnston. Some of you may not know who Johnston is, but he is the author behind&#160;so he knows quite a bit about who the erratic business mogul is and isn&#8217;t. In a newly released video, Johnston claims that there is absolutely no proof that Trump is the billionaire he says he is &#8211; adding another layer of deceit&#160;and fraud to Trump&#8217;s already horrendous track record. The clip was published by , where Johnston goes through Trump&#8217;s bragging claims and compares them to the actual data on the business mogul&#8217;s court records and bank filings. For example, Johnston says that last year, Trump said his&#160;net worth was&#160;$8.7 billion, $10 billion, $11 billion and higher, &#8220;even though there was nothing going on in the economy that would suggest that kind of gyrations of net worth.&#8221; The truth is, Trump is lying though his teeth.&#160;Johnston said: &#8220;The fact of the matter is that Donald Trump just makes it up.&#8221; Johnston also brought up a&#160;court testimony&#160;where Trump said he uses his gut &#8220;feelings&#8221; and &#8220;emotional state&#8221; to determine his net worth. Johnston joked about how &#8220;nuts&#8221; it was, and imitated&#160;Trump&#8217;s strategy: &#8220;By the way, I&#8217;m having a great day today.&#160;I think my net worth must be at least a billion dollars.&#8221; Johnston has been trying to get America to believe that Trump&#8217;s billionaire status was fake since 1990. During that time, a net worth statement by Trump&#8217;s bankers said that the GOP nominee&#8217;s net worth was actually&#160; $295 million. Johnston is still standing by the&#160;claim that Trump isn&#8217;t as&#160;successful as he seems, and continues to insist that although Trump is well off, there&#160;is &#8220;no evidence that he is a billionaire.&#8221; You can watch Johnston call out Trump&#8217;s lies&#160;below:  </mainText>

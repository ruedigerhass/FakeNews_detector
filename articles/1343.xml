    <mainText>Soon after Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said the GOP nominee believes &#8220;global warming is naturally occurring,&#8221; Mike Pence declared &#8220;there&#8217;s no question&#8221; human activities impact the climate. &#8220;There&#8217;s no question that the activities that take place in this country and in countries around the world have some impact on the environment and some impact on climate,&#8221; Pence, Trump&#8217;s running mate, said Tuesday on CNN. Story Continued Below The confusion came on the heels of Monday&#8217;s presidential debate, in which Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton pointed out that Trump previously said climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. &#8220;The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,&#8221; Trump wrote on Twitter in 2012. Trump later said it was a joke. On Tuesday, Pence told CNN it was &#8220;a humorous tweet&#8221; and sought to turn the argument on the Democrats. &#8220;What Donald Trump said was a hoax is that bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., can control the climate of the earth,&#8221; Pence said. &#8220;And the reality is that this climate change agenda that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want to continue to expand is killing jobs in this country.&#8221; Pence has repeatedly pledged that he and Trump will end the so-called &#8220;war on coal,&#8221; a reference to Obama administration policies that have led to the closures of a number of coal-fired power plants.</mainText>

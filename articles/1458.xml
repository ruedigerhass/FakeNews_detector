    <mainText>People can&#8217;t just leave well enough alone, can they? They can&#8217;t just let problems clear themselves up without trying to make things 1,000,000 times worse. Well, maybe not so much &#8220;people&#8221; as B.J. Murphy, a Muslim man who was chosen by Keith Lamont Scott&#8217;s family to speak about the man&#8217;s shooting death.  Of course, he couldn&#8217;t just leave without praising Allah and ordering more violence from the rioters who, for some reason, think that stealing TVs from Walmart is the appropriate way to &#8220;protest police brutality.&#8221; After telling the angry mob that blacks &#8220;don&#8217;t get no justice,&#8221; (because English is hard for some people) he said that he&#8217;s not &#8220;telling our brothers and sisters to stop,&#8221; referring to the crime that has been committed in the name of &#8220;justice.&#8221; You know, the same justice that they ain&#8217;t gettin&#8217; none of? Or something. His message was apparently SO effective that, according to the Daily Caller, Charlotte protesters were chanting &#8220;We&#8217;re like the Taliban!&#8221; That&#8217;s what we need, Muslims taking advantage of angry Americans and creating more home-grown terrorists. Can this guy be arrested for inciting violence? Maybe for inciting a riot? Oh, what am I saying&#8230; he&#8217;s one of the &#8220;protected classes&#8221; in America. The only thing the government would do to him is give him a federal job overseeing refugees and their paperwork. </mainText>

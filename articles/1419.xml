    <mainText>CNN recently ran an article titled, &#8220;Donald Trump defends racial profiling in wake of bombs.&#8221; Now, let&#8217;s first ignore the fact that once again, CNN is more upset over how we talk about the terror suspect&#160;and his religious affiliation than the fact that he allegedly set off bombs intended to hurt people and shot at cops during his capture. CNN claims Trump &#8220;reiterated his support for the controversial practice of racial profiling by police amid increasing threats to the homeland.&#8221; Translation: Donald Trump is a RAAAAAAACIST!  But here&#8217;s the thing. Trump never even mentioned racial profiling. He was praising Israel&#8217;s&#160;extraordinary vetting methods, which involves profiling, especially at the airport. And guess what? It works for them. &#8220;Our police are amazing. Our local police &#8212; they know who a lot of these people are. They are afraid to do anything about it because they don&#8217;t want to be accused of profiling and they don&#8217;t want to be accused of all sorts of things,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;You know, in Israel they profile. They&#8217;ve done an unbelievable job, as good as you can do. But Israel has done an unbelievable job, and they&#8217;ll profile. They see somebody that&#8217;s suspicious, they will profile. They will take that person and they&#8217;ll check out,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Do we have a choice? Look what&#8217;s going on. Do we really have a choice? We&#8217;re trying to be so politically correct in our country. And this is only going to get worse.&#8221; Profiling doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean racial profiling. CNN completely made that up, because they want to advance the false narrative that Trump&#8217;s a giant racist. CNN even admitted that Trump didn&#8217;t actually say &#8220;racial&#8221; profiling&#160;in that very article. Trump did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects, but it&#8217;s illegal for police to subject US persons to disparate treatment based on their race or other protected status. So Trump &#8220;did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects,&#8221; but in the VERY FIRST PARAGRAPH, CNN definitively claims that he&#160;&#8220;reiterated his support for the controversial practice of racial profiling by police.&#8221; They made a claim and basically debunked it two paragraphs later. In what world is that considered fair and balanced reporting?</mainText>

    <mainText>Fox News host Sean Hannity will host another town hall event with Donald Trump on Wednesday, September 21, the cable channel announced Monday. The town hall, which will be held in Cleveland, Ohio, will be broadcast at 10 p.m. on Fox News. Hannity, who is a vocal Trump supporter, will host the town hall along with Ohio-based pastor Darrell Scott, who has made headlines for his support of the Republican candidates. Hannity has hosted a few town halls with Trump both during the Republican primary process and since Trump was confirmed as the GOP nominee. The most recent town hall was in late August. This week's event will focus on the "core issues and concerns surrounding African-Americans," according to the channel.</mainText>

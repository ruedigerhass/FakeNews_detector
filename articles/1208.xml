    <mainText>Two months after he was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention for snubbing his party&#8217;s presidential nominee, Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday. That declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the Texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly &#8212; in part responding to Trump&#8217;s attacks on his wife and father. Story Continued Below 1. Early on, Cruz speculated that Trump&#8217;s tax returns could show a mob connection In February, Cruz offered his take on why Trump hadn&#8217;t released his tax returns in an interview on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the Press,&#8221; suggesting that they might show &#8220;Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.&#8221; &#8220;The fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that there&#8217;s a bombshell there,&#8221; Cruz said. &#8220;It&#8217;s natural to wonder, &#8216;Well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes?&#8217;&#8221; 2. In March, Cruz called him a &#8220;sniveling coward&#8221; Speaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to &#8220;spill the beans&#8221; on the senator&#8217;s wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, &#8220;Donald, you&#8217;re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s not easy to tick me off. I don&#8217;t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that&#8217;ll do it every time,&#8221; Cruz said. 3. He also called Trump a &#8220;big, loud New York bully&#8221; &#8220;Let me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds,&#8221; Cruz said. &#8220;It is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.&#8221; 4. Also, &#8220;a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women&#8221; Trump&#8217;s attacks, Cruz suggested, were actions of &#8220;a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.&#8221; 5. Cruz called one of Trump&#8217;s theories &#8220;nuts&#8221; and &#8220;just kooky&#8221; In May, after Trump cited a National Enquirer report that alleged Cruz&#8217;s father may have had some involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: &#8220;This morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, let&#8217;s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.&#8221; 6. He also called him a &#8220;pathological liar&#8221; who &#8220;lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth&#8221; Also in Indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added: &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. He doesn&#8217;t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.&#8221; 7. And Cruz was specific with the term &#8220;pathological&#8221;: Trump is &#8220;utterly amoral,&#8221; he said &#8220;I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he&#8217;d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he&#8217;s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,&#8221; Cruz said. 8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a &#8220;serial philanderer&#8221; Continuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered: &#8220;He combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don&#8217;t think this country&#8217;s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, &#8216;Dude, what&#8217;s your problem?&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; And: &#8220;Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. This is not a secret. He&#8217;s proud of being a serial philanderer.&#8221; 9. In July, Cruz still hadn&#8217;t forgiven Trump for the attacks on his family &#8220;I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,&#8221; Cruz said, answering questions at a Texas delegation breakfast at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing Trump. Referring to his pledge to support his party&#8217;s nominee, Cruz said that statement &#8220;was not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack Heidi I'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog" and support him.</mainText>

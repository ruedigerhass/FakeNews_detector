    <mainText>Matt Lauer is being skinned alive by the leftwingnut media for his honest presidential forum with Hillary and Trump. They are calling for his head on a platter for asking Hillary about her email crimes. The rightwing saw the interview as a surprise since leftists normally do their utmost to shield Hillary and avoid exposing her crimes. But then they saw that Lauer didn&#8217;t go into as much detail as they would have and that he did go after Trump, but not to the degree with which leftist fanatics would have and that has sent those leftwingnuts over the edge.

If you are ignorant because you listen to the leftwingnut media spin then you will probably think my opinion is wrong because you think my facts are lies. There are leftwingnuts who have chastised bloggers as false because we express our opinions, as if by doing so that makes what we say not the truth. Expressing your opinion of an event does not make the facts of that event a lie &#8211; except in the narrow minds of ignorant liberals.

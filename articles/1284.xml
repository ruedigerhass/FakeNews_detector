    <mainText>Hillary Clinton warned about cyber-threats from Vladimir Putin. But Donald Trump is just as worried about obese, couch-bound hackers. Story Continued Below Clinton called recent cyber-attacks on various Democratic campaign arms, which are widely thought to be at the hands of Russian intelligence, &#8220;the most recent and most troubling&#8221; infiltrations from state actors. &#8220;I know Donald&#8217;s very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a very tough, long game here,&#8221; Clinton said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans'&#8221; systems, Clinton said, adding that such comments make Trump &#8220;unfit to be the commander in chief.&#8221; But Trump said he&#8217;s not convinced that Putin is behind the attacks. &#8220;She said Russia, Russia, Russia, maybe it was. Could also be China,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;Could also be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.&#8221; Regardless, Trump didn&#8217;t miss an opportunity to highlight one of the most notable findings from the hack of the Democratic National Committee&#8217;s emails: that members of the party leadership were working against Sen. Bernie Sanders&#8217;s primary challenge against Clinton. &#8220;We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz,&#8221; Trump said, before referring to her subsequent ouster as the party chair. &#8220;Whether that was Russia, whether that was China, we don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</mainText>

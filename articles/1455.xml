    <mainText>One of former President&#160;Bill Clinton&#8217;s&#160;oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she&#8217;s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state. Dolly Kyle, author of &#8220;Hillary the Other Woman,&#8221; said Clinton has been &#8220;&#8217;cruisin&#8217; for a bruisin&#8217;,&#8221; because she&#8217;s so angry and driven by rage. &#8220;People like that eventually break down, physically.&#8221; &#8220;Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,&#8221; Kyle told WND. &#8220;Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she&#8217;s suffering from real cognitive impairment.&#8221; Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks. These symptoms coupled with Clinton&#8217;s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster. &#8220;That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,&#8221; Kyle said, and it&#8217;s simply not a good combination for anyone &#8212; much less the president of the United States. Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton &#8212; and Clinton&#8217;s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture. Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants &#8212; even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle. &#8220;She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton&#8217;s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,&#8221; the lawyer said. This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

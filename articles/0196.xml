    <mainText>It&#8217;s night-impossible to spend five minutes in a Fox News comment thread without coming across something that would give even a Klansman pause to say &#8220;hey man, can you tone it down? That&#8217;s a bit too racist.&#8221; But buried within the Stupid Part of America&#8217;s criticisms of a kind, 6-year-old New York boy who wrote to President Obama to ask if a little Syrian boy &#160;who was rescued from a building that had been hit by an airstike was a comment from one of Trump&#8217;s &#8220;deplorables&#8221; that explains why conservatives are the way they are. &#160; &#8220;Dear President Obama. Remember the boy who was picked up by the ambulance in Syria?&#8221; the boy, Alex, read in a video posted by the White House.&#160;&#8220;Can you please go get him and bring him to our home? Park in the driveway or on the streets and we&#8217;ll be waiting for you guys with flags, flowers and balloons.&#8221; &#8220;We will give him a family and he will be our brother,&#8221; Alex says.&#160;&#8220;Catherine, my little sister, will be collecting butterflies and fireflies for him. &#8220;We can invite him to birthday parties and he will teach us another language &#8230; And I will share my bike and I will teach him how to ride it. I will teach him additions and subtractions in math.&#8221; &#8220;These are the words of a six-year-old boy &#8212; a young child who has not learned to be cynical or suspicious or fearful of other people because of where they come from, how they look, or how they pray,&#8221; Obama wrote on his Facebook page, adding &#8220;we should all be more like Alex.&#8221; It&#8217;s a beautiful story &#8211; one of hope and pure love that all of us should feel fortunate just to be aware of. &#160;Naturally, conservatives had to sh*t all over it:  You might be wondering how a group of people can be so racist and&#8230;deplorable. Fortunately, one of them hopped out of the basket to inform you. &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with being a racist?&#8221; one commenter calling himself &#8220;VarnstarkBittlewater&#8221; asks when someone remarks that the comments got quite, quite racist. Another person, &#8220;pdubya,&#8221; replies &#8220;everyone is&#8221; to which Mr. Bittlewater responds, &#8220;my point exactly.&#8221;  In case you missed it, conservatives genuinely believe everyone &#8212; black, white, polka-dot &#8212; is a racist at his or her core, and that this excuses their racism. After all, &#8220;if everyone is doing it&#8230;&#8221; You can watch the video below. At least&#160;you&#8217;ll appreciate how awesome it is:  Featured image via screengrab</mainText>

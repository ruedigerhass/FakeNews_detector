    <mainText>This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a &#8220;bombing/&#8221; CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that &#8212; even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary&#8217;s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it. In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was &#8220;insensitive&#8221; for calling the Chelsea bombing a &#8220;bombing.&#8221; Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton&#8217;s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter&#8217;s question.   Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. &#8220;CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it&#8217;s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word &#8216;bombs&#8217; also by the way&#8230; I was criticized for calling it correctly &#8211; what I said was exactly correct.&#8221; He also pointed the finger at &#8220;stupid&#8221; leaders going soft on terrorism. &#8220;Well it&#8217;s a mess and it&#8217;s a shame and we&#8217;re going to have to be very tough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think we&#8217;re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.&#8221; He explained that &#8220;because we&#8217;ve been weak, out country&#8217;s been weak, we&#8217;re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I&#8217;ve been saying you&#8217;ve got to stop it.&#8221;  .@realDonaldTrump slams "dishonest" CNN for editing out Clinton reference to NYC explosion as 'bombing' pic.twitter.com/EG2Yy63B4y &#8212; FOX &amp; Friends (@foxandfriends) September 19, 2016   Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 &#8212; and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. &#8220;Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he&#8217;s letting in and he&#8217;s letting in thousands of thousands of people&#8230; they can&#8217;t be properly vetted,&#8221; said Trump. &#8220;He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent&#8230; thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we&#8217;re doing. Our leaders are &#8211; I don&#8217;t even say weak &#8211; I say stupid.&#8221; </mainText>

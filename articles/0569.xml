    <mainText>Barack Obama is planning on leaving office the same way he came in, making things all about him. &#160;Speaking to a Congressional Black Caucus event on Saturday Night, the narcissist-in-chief said he would take it as a personal insult if Black voters&#160;didn&#8217;t turn out and vote for&#160;Hillary Clinton. I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election.&#160;You want to give me a good send-off, go vote. (&#8230;) Obama also sought to blunt Trump&#8217;s recent efforts to reach out to black voters, saying Trump at one point in the race had said there&#8217;s never been a worse time to be a black person. &#8220;I mean, he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery and Jim Crow, but we&#8217;ve got a museum for him to visit,&#8221; Obama said, a reference to next week&#8217;s opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. &#8220;We will educate him.&#8221; Obama may have been referring to an ABC interview with Trump in 2015 when he asserted the nation&#8217;s first black president had done &#8220;nothing&#8221; for African-Americans. &#8220;They are worse now than just about ever,&#8221; he said. While it is not the worst time ever for African Americans, it&#8217;s been pretty bad. &#160;The chart below uses&#160;Census Bureau data&#160;to show what has happened to household income&#160;African American and all U.S. households&#160;under Obama. It shows median household income for every year from Bush #43&#8217;s final year (2008-in red) through 2015. Each Obama year is compared to the final Bush year.

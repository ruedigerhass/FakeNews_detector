    <mainText>Hillary Clinton didn't hold back in her attacks on Donald Trump Monday night, but Donald Trump intimated that he pulled a key punch &#8212;&#160;passing on making a reference to Bill Clinton's past infidelities. &#8220;I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,&#8221; Trump said in reply. &#8220;It's inappropriate. It's not nice.&#8221; Story Continued Below Trump's veiled reference followed a tough attack from Clinton, who referenced his past comments about women being &#8220;pigs&#8221; and &#8220;dogs&#8221; and said Trump &#8220;loves hanging around beauty contests&#8221; during Monday night&#8217;s debate. &#8220;He tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,&#8221; Clinton said. Trump also said that Clinton has been hitting him &#8220;with tremendous commercials. Some of it's in entertainment.&#8221; Trump added that Rosie O&#8217;Donnell, the focus of some of his comments has &#8220;been very tough to me.&#8221; Clinton has spent &#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads ... many of which are untrue, and they're misrepresentations, and I will tell you this, Lester, it's not nice, and I don't deserve that, but it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done,&#8221; Trump added. &#8220;I&#8217;m very happy that I was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton,&#8221; Trump told reporters after the debate. &#8220;Because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton and I just didn&#8217;t want to say what I was going to say.&#8221; And what exactly, a reporter asked, was that going to be? &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you maybe at the next debate, we&#8217;ll see,&#8221; he responded.</mainText>

    <mainText>When Donald Trump said he was hoping for a collapse in the housing market before the Great Recession, it was just smart business sense, he said in the first sharp exchange of the debate. &#8220;In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis,&#8221; Hillary Clinton said when discussing the recovery from the Great Recession. &#8220;He said back in 2006, &#8216;Gee, I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and buy some and make some money. Well it did collapse.&#8221; Story Continued Below &#8220;That&#8217;s called business, by the way,&#8221; Trump said, interrupting. But Clinton talked over him. &#8220;Nine million people lost their jobs, five million people lost their homes,&#8221; she said. Clinton appeared to be referencing when Trump, in 2006, said regarding a crash: &#8220;I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy.&#8221;</mainText>

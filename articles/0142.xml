    <mainText>Months ago, former First Lady Laura Bush shocked Americans when she said she&#226;&#128;&#153;d rather vote for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton than a Republican this election. For the most part, former presidential candidate Jeb Bush and former presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush have opted&#194;&#160;to stay out of this election &#226;&#128;&#147; until now. Word of George H.W. Bush&#226;&#128;&#153;s decision to snub the GOP by not voting for its disastrous Republican nominee just recently broke, and it&#226;&#128;&#153;s a super provocative move because not only is Bush refusing to support his party, but he is voting for the Democratic Party instead. It&#226;&#128;&#153;s a controversial decision, but obviously Bush recognizes that it&#226;&#128;&#153;s the smartest choice for the future of this country. The Trump campaign, as you can imagine, isn&#226;&#128;&#153;t taking this lightly. In an interview with CNN&#226;&#128;&#153;s Erin Burnett, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway reacted to the elder Bush&#226;&#128;&#153;s voting decision and couldn&#226;&#128;&#153;t have demonstrated any better how immature and bitter the campaign was about it. Conway said that although she &#226;&#128;&#152;respects&#226;&#128;&#153; Bush&#226;&#128;&#153;s choice, it&#226;&#128;&#153;s ironic that he&#226;&#128;&#153;s voting for&#194;&#160;&#226;&#128;&#156;the wife of the man who knocked him out of the race&#226;&#128;&#157; in 1992. Conway also&#194;&#160;chalked up Bush&#226;&#128;&#153;s decision to vote for Clinton to his emotions and &#226;&#128;&#156;hurt feelings&#226;&#128;&#157; over his son&#226;&#128;&#153;s loss to Trump in the primaries. She said: &#226;&#128;&#156;This was a bruising primary, and Jeb Bush really failed all expectations&#226;&#128;&#166; I know there are a lot of hurt feelings there.&#226;&#128;&#157; You can watch the interview below: &#226;&#128;&#156;Jeb Bush really failed&#226;&#128;&#166;there are a lot of hurt feelings&#226;&#128;&#157; @KellyannePolls on Bush 41 voting #Clinton https://t.co/iyhiLRgrPL &#226;&#128;&#148; OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 20, 2016  This response from the Trump campaign is exactly what we&#226;&#128;&#153;d expect it to be. The Bush family&#194;&#160;is making a responsible, informed decision during this election, and that is way too much for Trump and his minions to wrap their feeble minds around. This election is no joke &#226;&#128;&#147; it&#226;&#128;&#153;s about far more than Republican and Democrat parties. It&#226;&#128;&#153;s about saving the country from a candidate that will destroy it &#226;&#128;&#147; and the Bush&#226;&#128;&#153;s are smart enough to recognize that. </mainText>

    <mainText>A new video has emerged of the moments before and after police officers gunned down Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina a few days ago. But the video, filmed by Scott&#8217;s wife Rakeyia, does not show the exact shooting and still leaves many questions unanswered. The police video of the shooting has been seen by his mourning relatives. &#8220;When told by police to exit his vehicle, Mr. Scott did so in a very calm, nonaggressive manner.&#160;While police did give him several commands, he did not aggressively approach them or raise his hands at members of law enforcement at any time. Mr. Scott&#8217;s hands were by his side, and he was slowly walking backwards&#8221; said family attorney Justin Bamberg. A picture has emerged that purports to show that Scott had a gun but it is still unclear who it belonged to or if it is a gun at all. In any case, North Carolina is an open-carry state with loose firearm laws, which more often than not seem to apply only to white people. In the video, the cops keep yelling &#8220;DROP THE GUN&#8221; while Rakeyia Scott keeps telling them that he doesn&#8217;t, and that what he&#160;does have is a traumatic brain injury and that he just took his medicine. &#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot him. Don&#8217;t shoot him. He has no weapon. He has no weapon. Don&#8217;t shoot him!&#8221; she pleads as officers yell &#8211; in an extremely unprofessional fashion &#8211; &#8220;DROP THE F*CKING GUN!&#8221; Why the officers were in a standoff with Scott at all is still unclear, as they were there to serve a warrant on someone else. But as happens far too often in the United States, Scott was executed without charges or trial.&#160;Protests by angry citizens demanding the release of the tapes continued into a third night as the governor declared a state of emergency and imposed a midnight to 6 am curfew. Police have continued to refuse to release the tapes as their &#8220;investigation&#8221; continues. Watch the video here. Viewer discretion is advised, as it is very disturbing and contains profane language: </mainText>

    <mainText>The 2016 election is shaping up to be the weirdest&#160;(and nightmarish) election in decades. Up is down, night is day, and stupid is smart. Once Donald Trump became the nominee of a major party for the presidency, all existing and established norms&#160;went up in smoke. And the crazy is just getting started, so make sure you&#8217;ve got your passport handy. Politico writes that Former President George H.W. Bush is completely snubbing Donald Trump and plans to vote for Hillary Clinton in November. This revelation came from&#160;Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy announced the news on Facebook yesterday when she posted a picture &#160;shaking hands next to Bush Sr with this caption: &#8220;The President told me he&#8217;s voting for Hillary!!&#8221; This is actually not very shocking when you&#160;consider how much the Bushes have shown their contempt for Trump, after ruining their chances of continuing their political dynasty with low-energy Jeb. Neither&#160;George Bush Sr. or George W. Bush showed up at the Republican&#160;National Convention&#160;in Cleveland, and Jeb Bush has constantly let it be known that he has absolutely no intentions of voting for Trump. So perhaps this can be viewed as more of a repudiation of Trump than a glowing endorsement of Hillary. Former First Lady Laura Bush dropped a major bombshell in April of this year when she essentially indicated that she was supporting Hillary. Here&#8217;s what Laura Bush about the presidential race: &#8220;I want our next president &#8211; whoever he or she might be &#8211; to be somebody who is interested in women in Afghanistan and who will continue US policies&#8230; that we continue to do what we&#8217;re committed to do as a country,&#8221; she said, as she appeared on stage alongside her twin daughters Jenna and Barbara. &#8220;That&#8217;s who I want &#8211; or the kind of people that will do that and will pay attention to our history, and know what&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened before and know specifically how we can continue to do the good things that we do around the world.&#8221; Say what you will about George W. Bush&#8211;and there&#8217;s plenty&#8211;but his father was mostly a man of principle who put the country above petty politics. This is yet another reminder of how fractured the Republican Party has become. Featured image via Getty&#160;  Republicans thought this would be a cake walk. Boy were they wrong.</mainText>

    <mainText>(EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: This video contains graphic content that may be emotionally disturbing for viewers.) A video of Keith Lamont Scott&#8217;s final moments, filmed by Scott&#8217;s wife, Rakeiya, has been made public. In the video, obtained by NBC News, Charlotte-Mecklenburg (CMPD) police officers are seen approaching the car where Scott, a father of seven, was waiting for his child&#8217;s school bus to arrive. Rakeiya Scott is heard shouting, &#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot him! He has no weapon!&#8221; while police are heard in the distance shouting at Keith Scott to &#8220;drop the gun.&#8221; &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t have a gun&#8230; he&#8217;s not going to do anything to you guys. He just took his medicine,&#8221; Rakeiya Scott said.  After four shots were fired, Scott is heard repeatedly shouting, &#8220;Did you shoot him?&#8221; And runs over to her husband&#8217;s car. &#8220;He better not be fucking dead, he better not be fucking dead, I know that fucking much,&#8221; Scott said as officers ordered her to come to them. &#8220;We are at 9453 Lexington Court, and these are the police officers who just shot my husband,&#8221; Rakeiya Scott said. &#8220;He better live.&#8221; From the angle of the recording, it is unclear as to what led up to the killing of 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott. As of this writing, CMPD officers have not released the body camera video of Scott&#8217;s death, despite calls from the community and even the New York Times editorial board to release it. Police were on the scene to search for a man with outstanding warrants, who was not Scott. However, Scott was nonetheless shot and killed by CMPD officers who allege he was brandishing a firearm. Scott&#8217;s mother, Vernita Scott Walker, told CBS News he was sitting in his car, waiting for his child&#8217;s school bus, and reading the Koran, which he did every day. &#8220;That&#8217;s a task for him every day, so he can be out there to get a special spot,&#8221; Walker said.&#8221;He sits in the truck and reads his book.&#8221; &#160;      </mainText>

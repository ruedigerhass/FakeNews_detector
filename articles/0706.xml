How do you explain that, Joel?&#8221;  Benenson first said that limited immunity is &#8220;fairly routine.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s fairly appropriate and routine when people are sitting down with them, turning over a wealth of materials that have nothing to do with the investigation at hand,&#8221; Benenson said&#8230;&#8230;.

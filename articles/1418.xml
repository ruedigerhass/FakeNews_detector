    <mainText>Hillary Clinton recently appeared on Jimmy Fallon&#8217;s The Tonight Show. Jimmy Fallon was all jokes about Hillary&#8217;s health as he reached under his desk and grabbed a surgical mask and put it on. I&#8217;m guessing that was his way of pushing the idea that Hillary&#8217;s health issues are nothing more than the flu or bad cold.   Hillary of course laughed her cackling laugh with the audience and then Fallon high-fived her. After touching her hand, Fallon reached under the desk for some hand sanitizer. I admit it was a funny gag. Fallon is a clever guy and will do all he can to help his candidate of choice. Voters DO have a right to be concerned and many medical professionals are: Hillary&#8217;s Health Concerns Serious, Say Most Doctors Polled by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) Concerns about Hillary Clinton&#8217;s health are &#8220;serious&#8212;could be disqualifying for the position of President of the U.S.,&#8221; say nearly 71% of 250 physicians responding to an informal internet survey by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS). About 20% said concerns were &#8220;likely overblown, but should be addressed as by full release of medical records.&#8221; Only 2.7% responded that they were &#8220;just a political attack; I have confidence in the letter from her physician and see no cause for concern.&#8221; While more than 81% were aware of her history of a concussion, only 59% were aware of the cerebral sinus thrombosis, and 52% of the history of deep venous thrombosis. More than 78% said the health concerns had received &#8220;not enough emphasis&#8221; in the media, and only 2.7% that there had been &#8220;too much emphasis.&#8221; So THIS is how you treat the Presidency of the United States. Make fun of voters concerns over the health of candidates who may become President of the United States. I&#8217;m so disgusted with the Left and the irony of it all is that Liberals are upset with Fallon&#8217;s satire on Hillary&#8217;s health. Boy they are a bunch of dumb nuts.

    <mainText>Join the Citizen Journalist Revolution at www.iPatriot.com Terrorism is terrorism, regardless of the source, and two American cities felt the sting of it over the weekend. Is it really that hard to say? Apparently. And if someone on the left does summon up the word, it must always be supplemented with a descriptor. One of two terrorist attacks, a bombing, occurred this weekend in Manhattan, N.Y. &#8220;No-one has come forward to admit to planting the device, which exploded in a dumpster,&#8221;&#160;Cuomo said,&#160;but citizens should make no mistake: &#8220;a bomb exploding in New York is an act of terrorism.&#8221; Got that.

I don&#8217;t know, but I wouldn&#8217;t doubt it. The Manhattan bomber may not be the work of an Islamist, but the attack at a Minnesota mall on Saturday sure was. As I stated, regardless of the source, the two acts were terrorism none the less. It is not hard to say &#8211; terrorism, unless you&#8217;re NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, who, like many apologists on the left, just couldn&#8217;t bring himself to utter the word. When pressed, he merely stated&#8230; Read the rest of the story at www.iPatriot.com  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.</mainText>

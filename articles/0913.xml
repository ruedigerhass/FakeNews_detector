    <mainText>After months of quiet, mass shootings&#160;once again&#160;shake the nation. Around six a.m this morning, a &#8220;disgruntled lawyer&#8221;&#160;opened fire at a mall in Houston, Texas, injuring&#160;nine before he was killed by police officers. Shooter Nathan Desai was found to have had multiple weapons in his vehicle &#8211; all of them legal, as was his right to openly carry his weapons into a public space. As this man was not a Muslim, the media narrative is that Desai was apparently a &#8220;disgruntled&#8221; lawyer who was frustrated with his firm&#8217;s closing due to lack of customers. But this story gets even weirder.&#160;Law enforcement sources said that the shooter was wearing what appeared to be an antique German uniform with swastikas on it, and reports indicate that more Nazi paraphernalia&#160;was discovered in his apartment. Why Desai was wearing a Nazi uniform, where he got it, and any relation to white supremacy or neo-Nazi groups are still unclear at the moment. But his attempt to slaughter his countrymen was the 288th mass shooting in this country so far this year, according to&#160;watchdog&#160;group GunViolenceArchive.org. Texas&#8217; absurdly lax weapons laws resulted once again in a man opening fire into innocents. There was no good guy with a gun to save the day; just an angry Nazi lawyer.</mainText>

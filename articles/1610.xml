    <mainText>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump held a &#8220;town hall style&#8221; meeting in Cleveland Heights with the alleged goal of discussing &#8220;African-American concerns,&#8221; strangely hosted by Sean Hannity via Fox News. The only problem: Hardly any African-Americans attended. Former Digital Director and Deputy Director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Brandon English noted on social media today the noticeably white audience attending Trump&#8217;s event. In fact, there seemed to be more African Americans on stage behind Hannity&#160;than in the audience.

The literature said &#8220;When Christians don&#8217;t vote we lose our voice,&#8221; implying that&#160;the election&#8217;s results will decide &#8220;Whether or not Religious Liberty is protected.&#8221; As English noted, 42% Cleveland Heights is black, and yet well over 95% of the town hall&#8217;s attendees appeared to be white. This lends credence to the polls which predict a dismal African-American turnout for Trump, despite his claims to the contrary. FYI Cleveland Heights is 42% Black pic.twitter.com/z3Xe6eAYvz &#8212; Brandon English (@brandonenglish) September 21, 2016  Trump didn&#8217;t&#160;focus on courting&#160;African American votes until late in his campaign, an outreach initiative that seems to be yielding little results. The central&#160;pitch to black Americans has repeatedly been &#8220;What do you have to lose?&#8221; If attendance at these events is any indication, perhaps they feel that a Trump vote could stand to lose them quite a bit.  &#160;     </mainText>

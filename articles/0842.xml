    <mainText>The first Presidential debate took place last night, and while it felt quite short in scope, it made up for it in Trump&#8217;s trademark quick-witted humor. I think the night should have been called &#8220;The Roast of Hillary Clinton,&#8221; because she got wrecked and her lies came back in full force to destroy any argument she had against Trump. Hillary not only started floundering, but Trump turned her into a stuttering mess, complaining that she&#8217;s being picked on, as if Trump was some schoolyard bully instead of a major political candidate that called her out on her countless lies. When Hillary says that she&#8217;ll be blamed for every bad thing that&#8217;s ever happened, Trump, without skipping a beat, he says &#8220;Why not?&#8221; Mic. Drop. That&#8217;s the exact moment when Hillary knew that her days of politicking were over. See for yourself:  This was&#160;perhaps the most satisfying series of clips I&#8217;ve seen this week. I cannot stop watching and cheering. Share this everywhere. (Source: YouTube) </mainText>

    <mainText>Through the course of this election season, a dark cloud has hung over Trump&#8217;s campaign &#8211; OK, many dark clouds. Dark, racist, xenophobic, lying clouds. But the one we&#8217;re referencing here is &#8220;what the hell is going on with his taxes?&#8221; The simple answer, as Trump revealed during the first presidential debate, is that The Donald simply hasn&#8217;t paid any federal income tax. Trump blamed Clinton for &#8220;squandering&#8221; taxpayer dollars, thus depriving us of much-needed infrastructure improvements &#8212; the kind Republicans like Trump typically vote against. Clinton, of course, took the opportunity to get in a dig about the GOP nominee&#8217;s own taxes. &#8220;Maybe because you haven&#8217;t paid any federal income tax in a lot of years,&#8221; Clinton shot back, expertly placing the bait in the trap. And, of course, she didn&#8217;t have to wait long for Trump to try to grab the cheese. To emphasize his point, he accidentally admitted that she&#8217;s exactly right: &#8220;It would be squandered too, believe me.&#8221; Pay attention to the word &#8220;would.&#8221; Trump would not have said that if he had paid taxes, which he called &#8220;smart&#8221; earlier in the debate. Is this the reason he doesn&#8217;t want to reveal his taxes, which he says he will release &#8220;against his lawyer&#8217;s wishes&#8221; if Clinton releases deleted emails? Does Trump not want the voting public to know that he&#8217;s a deadbeat who absolutely does not pay his fair share? When Trump says &#8220;believe me,&#8221; believe him &#8212; not that his tax dollars would be &#8220;squandered&#8221; but that he believes they &#8220;would&#8221; if he had paid any.

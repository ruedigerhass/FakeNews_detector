    <mainText>Donald Trump&#8217;s White House bid is &#8220;a movement, not a campaign,&#8221; a new ad released by the Manhattan billionaire proclaims. The 30-second TV spot, announced Tuesday via email by the Trump campaign, is entitled &#8220;Movement&#8221; and features a string of phrases describing the GOP nominee as a &#8220;builder, businessman, success&#8221; and praising him for &#8220;doing what others called impossible.&#8221; Story Continued Below Cutting quickly between video of construction sites, Trump himself and seemingly ordinary American families and children, the video touts the real estate mogul&#8217;s campaign as &#8220;dreaming big&#8221; and &#8220;building bigger.&#8221; Among other claims, the ad says Trump&#8217;s candidacy is &#8220;defined by freedom&#8221; and &#8220;leaving the past behind.&#8221; The latter statement from the ad&#8217;s unseen narrator is accompanied by video from a 1992 &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; interview with Bill and Hillary Clinton in which the former president denied having an affair with Gennifer Flowers, a woman Bill Clinton would later admit to having had a sexual relationship with. &#8220;While Hillary Clinton &#8216;distracts and diverts&#8217; attention away from her horrific record with negative advertisements that lack substance, our campaign plans on promoting the positive energy that has turned Mr. Trump&#8217;s campaign into a full-fledged movement,&#8221; Trump campaign senior communications adviser Jason Miller said in a statement that accompanied the ad&#8217;s release.</mainText>

    <mainText>Judge Jeanine Pirro has been all over Hillary Clinton and her lack of truthfulness ever since the infamous email scandal broke. We don&#8217;t blame her, Hillary&#8217;s lies have, in all likelihood, gotten people killed and put America at risk, not to mention the fact that she&#8217;s lied to Congress and the FBI and countless other government bodies. So, Pirro&#160;decided to take Clinton down on the&#160;eve of the first presidential debate, in the classiest way possible &#8211; by propping up Trump.&#160;Epic.  &#8220;Donald, it&#8217;s real simple.&#160; You&#8217;re new at this.&#160; If you are yourself, you will obliterate her like you did those 16 others on those Republican primary debate stages,&#8221; Pirro said of her longtime friend, Donald Trump. &#8220;Your opponent cannot handle the truth. She can&#8217;t handle a direct question. Nor is she able to give a direct response.&#160; Do not let her do the Washington two-step.&#160; Stay on offense.&#160; Without being offensive.&#8221; Pirro also suggested Trump should ignore Clinton&#8217;s gender as a reason to be considerably kinder to her than he would if he were debating a man. &#8220;She wants to be the leader of the free world&#8211; gender is irrelevant. Make her prove she&#8217;s up to it both mentally, physically and historically.&#8221; She also advised he be more &#8220;presidential&#8221; than in prior debates, where nicknames like &#8220;Lyin&#8217; Ted&#8221;and &#8220;Little Marco&#8221; were common expressions: &#8220;You&#8217;re a smart man Donald. This is the time to be presidential.&#160; No smirks.&#160; No faces.&#8221; Pirro suggested to Clinton that she too be herself&#8212;&#8220;Cold.&#160; Calculating. Imperialistic.&#8221; &#8220;And Hillary, don&#8217;t shy away from talking about your record.&#160; The state of the world in chaos with you in charge of foreign policy&#8211; unless of course you don&#8217;t want to,&#8221; she said. Will you be watching the debate tonight? Let&#8217;s hear it in the comments! (Source: Fox News) </mainText>

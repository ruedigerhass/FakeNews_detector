    <mainText>Hillary Clinton is a copycat who&#8217;s probably sleeping because she needs to rest, Donald Trump suggested Tuesday. In a pair of tweets bookended by a post announcing &#8220;two big rallies&#8221; in North Carolina, Trump accused the Democratic presidential nominee of &#8220;copying my airplane&#8221; and continued his assault over her stamina, or alleged lack thereof. Story Continued Below &#8220;Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies &#8212; she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning,&#8221; Trump mused in a tweet Tuesday morning. &#8220;Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest,&#8221; he added minutes later. &#8220;Sleep well Hillary &#8212; see you at the debate!&#8221; Trump&#8217;s critical comments come shortly after Clinton warned voters during a radio interview with Steve Harvey, &#8220;The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years.&#8221; Clinton also previewed what she expects from Trump in Monday's presidential debate in New York, telling Harvey she will do her &#8220;very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we&#8217;ve seen coming from my opponent.&#8221; &#8220;You know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been at this and, you know, I understand it&#8217;s a contact sport.&#8221; Trump also attacked Clinton earlier Tuesday, questioning her effectiveness against the Islamic State as head of the State Department. &#8220;Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.&#8221; Clinton has no public events planned for Tuesday and has opted to stay at home in Chappaqua, New York, as she prepares for the debate with Trump. She had a full campaign schedule on Monday &#8212; between holding a news conference in White Plains, New York, a campaign speech and a fundraiser in Philadelphia, and three meetings with foreign leaders in New York City. She is scheduled to return to Florida for a campaign rally and fundraiser on Wednesday. Gabriel Debenedetti contributed to this report.</mainText>

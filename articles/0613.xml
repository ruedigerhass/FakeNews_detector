    <mainText>Do you remember Clock Boy, Ahmed Mohamad? You know, the Texas Muslim teen who brought a &#8220;clock&#8221; that didn&#8217;t look like a clock but rather like a bomb, to school then cried Islamaphobia when people freaked out because it looked like a bomb? You know, the Texas Muslim teen who was praised by Barack Obama for making a &#8220;cool clock&#8221; that didn&#8217;t look like a clock but he got invited to the White House anyway. You know, the Texas Muslim teen who received tons of gifts and adulation&#160;from Microsoft and a special invitation from Facebook to visit the company&#8217;s headquarters? You know, the Texas Muslim teen who went to live in Qatar&#160;for a year after receiving a scholarship to the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development because of his bomb-looking clock. (He&#8217;s now back in America.) You know, the Texas Muslim teen who is suing the city of Irving, Texas for $15 million and apologies from the police chief and mayor, continuing to try to milk his bomb-looking clock incident for all it&#8217;s worth? Yeah, that kid. Here is what he tweeted on the 15-year anniversary of 9/11. RIP the 2977 americans who died in 9/11 and RIP the 2 million innocent muslims who died during the US invasion for something they didnt do. &#8212; Ahmed Mohamed (@IStandWithAhmed) September 11, 2016  One guy, who was obviously a former supporter of Clock Boy, let him know that his slam against 9/11 was &#8220;not cool&#8221; so he would be unfollowing. @IStandWithAhmed not cool. You never take a national tragedy and politicize it unless you wanna be a jerk. Unfollowing &#8212; Brad Adair (@bpadair) September 11, 2016  Will Microsoft be sending him more gifts now? h/t Glenn Beck  Email Subscribe</mainText>

    <mainText>Target garnered intense criticism for a Christmas sweater that seemingly mocked people who suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder. The store received backlash from customers who felt the sweater, which had the phrase &#8220;Obsessive Christmas Disorder&#8221; written on the front, belittled and mocked a serious mental disorder.&#160; &#8220;As someone with OCD I&#8217;d really appreciate it if you didn&#8217;t sell my illness as a fashion statement,&#8221; Twitter user Reign Murphy tweeted alongside a photo of her holding up the sweater.&#160;  Others reacted similarly to the controversy, with several blasting the retail giant for mocking a &#8220;serious mental illness.&#8221; "Today at Target I saw a sweater that said 'OCD Obsessive Christmas Disorder'&#8230;why is trivializing a mental disorder so widely accepted?&#8221; one tweet about the sweater read. Target ultimately responded to the backlash with an apology, but stopped short of removing the item from its stores. &#8220;We never want to disappoint our guests and we apologize for any discomfort. We currently do not have plans to remove this sweater,&#8221; spokesman Josh Thomas said in the statement.  Target was previously the center of similar controversy regarding a sign that referenced &#8220;building sets&#8221; and &#8220;girls&#8217; building sets&#8221; for sale. It was also criticized for selling a women's T-shirt with the word &#8220;Trophy&#8221; on the front, which inspired a successful petition for its removal. &#8220;The truth is that millions of women and young girls are taken as &#8216;trophies&#8217; every year in war, sex trafficking, slavery, and rape,&#8221; the petition said, Fortune reported. &#8220;Labeling any person as a &#8216;Trophy&#8217; is demeaning their humanity and objectifying them as a tangible object that can be bought, used, and disposed of.&#8221; Target responded to that controversy by apologizing for offending customers. &#8220;It is never our intention to offend anyone,&#8221; the company&#8217;s statement read. &#8220;These shirts are intended as a fun wink and we have received an overwhelmingly positive response from our guests.&#8221; Sources: USA Today, Fortune / Photo credit: Reign Murphy/Twitter via Spectacular Photo Wonders&#160;</mainText>

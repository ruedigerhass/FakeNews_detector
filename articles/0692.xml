    <mainText>A University of Houston professor agreed to distribute &#8220;emotional first-aid kits&#8221; to students, apparently not realizing it was a satirical ploy by James O&#8217;Keefe. The emotional first-aid kits contain a baby blanket, chocolates, a plush kitten, a bag containing the smell of lavender, ear plugs, a genderless pastel teddy bear, hand written notes, and a pacifier. Prof. Schindler did, however, express reservations about the pacifiers, which she feared might be taken the wrong way, and suggested advising students to suck their thumbs instead. An assistant professor at the University of Houston recently agreed to distribute &#8220;emotional first-aid kits&#8221; to students, apparently not realizing it was a satirical ploy by James O&#8217;Keefe.

Only the pacifier gave Schindler any pause, though only out of concern that students might take them the wrong way. Instead, she suggested that the kit just contain a note encouraging students to suck their thumbs&#8230; Read the rest of the story and watch the hidden cam VIDEO at Campus Reform  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.</mainText>

    <mainText>Even though Donald Trump (sort of) dropped the &#226;&#128;&#152;birther&#226;&#128;&#153; issue, there&#226;&#128;&#153;s one pro-Trump surrogate who &#226;&#128;&#147; in the tightest re-election fight of his life &#226;&#128;&#147; is still pledging to continue his investigation into President Obama&#226;&#128;&#153;s birth certificate. Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was recently recommended for criminal court due to the continuation of racial profiling and perjury, told a group of Tea Party activists that he is certain Barack Obama&#226;&#128;&#153;s birth certificate is forged and will do everything he can to prove it: &#226;&#128;&#156;I&#226;&#128;&#153;m not going to give up, and we&#226;&#128;&#153;re looking into it. I don&#226;&#128;&#153;t know how it&#226;&#128;&#153;s going to turn out.&#194;&#160;I don&#226;&#128;&#153;t care where he&#226;&#128;&#153;s from.&#194;&#160;We are looking at a forged document.&#194;&#160;Period.&#194;&#160;I had nothing to do with Trump on the birth certificate. We did it on our own, because of you guys.&#226;&#128;&#157; The room of 200 or so activists were of course energized by Arpaio&#226;&#128;&#153;s pledge to unleash the &#226;&#128;&#156;truth.&#226;&#128;&#157; Before speaking to the crowd, Arpaio told reporters that it was the Tea Party activists in Maricopa County that got him &#226;&#128;&#156;stuck&#226;&#128;&#157; with the birther issue after World Net Daily, a right-wing publication known for conspiracy theories, had a reporter speak to another group, and subsequently gathered almost 250 signatures demanding Arpaio investigate. He complied, launching his investigation last week. According to Arizona Central: Mike Zullo, the lead investigator on the case and&#194;&#160;commander of Arpaio&#226;&#128;&#153;s Cold Case Posse, told the crowd that he knew Trump&#226;&#128;&#153;s statement was a &#226;&#128;&#156;punch in the gut, because it was unexpected.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#194;&#160;Zullo said he thought Trump&#226;&#128;&#153;s statement was &#226;&#128;&#156;strategic.&#226;&#128;&#157;&#194;&#160;&#226;&#128;&#156;It&#226;&#128;&#153;s not going to deter us,&#226;&#128;&#157; Zullo said. &#226;&#128;&#156;It&#226;&#128;&#153;s not going to stop us. I am closer than ever.&#226;&#128;&#157; Zullo also claims that a nurse who worked at the hospital where President Obama was born, the&#194;&#160;Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, denies that such a birth ever happened. Well there you have it. Not only are Maricopa County residents footing the bill for Arpaio&#226;&#128;&#153;s legal woes (yet again), they are now paying for another &#226;&#128;&#156;investigation&#226;&#128;&#157; into President Obama&#226;&#128;&#153;s birth certificate. Is this what Republicans mean by &#226;&#128;&#156;fiscal responsibility?&#226;&#128;&#157; In Maricopa County, there are almost 4.2 million taxpaying citizens. And now they are paying their Sheriff&#226;&#128;&#153;s office their tax dollars to &#226;&#128;&#156;investigate&#226;&#128;&#157; some fringe conspiracy supported by 250 activists. Think about that. Maybe that&#226;&#128;&#153;s why Arpaio is losing his re-election bid to a Democrat, Paul Penzone, and it might also explain why his poll numbers are plummeting. Good thing he&#226;&#128;&#153;s focusing on the issues that matter. </mainText>

    <mainText>Donald Trump made his way into the spin room moments after the close of the debate and told reporters he was proud that he did not bring up former president Bill Clinton&#8217;s extramarital affairs. &#8220;I&#8217;m very happy that I was able to hold back on the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton,&#8221; Trump said to a gaggle of reporters. &#8220;Because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton and I just didn&#8217;t want to say what I was going to say.&#8221; Story Continued Below And what exactly, a reporter asked, was that going to be? &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you maybe at the next debate, we&#8217;ll see,&#8221; he responded. A candidate&#8217;s presence in the spin room, where surrogates and advisers typically pitch their take on the debate to reporters, was unusual. But Trump, with his wife Melania at his side, took a few questions. &#8220;I think it went better than I ever thought,&#8221; he said of the debate. &#8220;I loved it, I loved it.&#8221;</mainText>

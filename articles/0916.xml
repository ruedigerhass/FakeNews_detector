    <mainText>Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus appeared on CNN&#8217;s pre-Presidential Debate coverage Monday afternoon, absurdly joking with&#160;Wolf Blitzer that the Republican&#160;Party&#8217;s presidential candidate was ready for the debates because &#8220;he&#8217;d already been through 14 season finales&#8221; of Trump&#8217;s reality TV show The Apprentice. Of course, it makes absolutely no sense to equate&#160;a gaudy half-hour of programming that&#160;loosely&#160;classifies as entertainment&#160;with what is arguably the hardest and most significant hurdle in the journey to becoming the most powerful elected official on the planet, but false-equivalency is after all, the biggest theme of this election. In&#160;his latest act&#160;&#8220;The Donald,&#8221; who is apparently &#8220;not a fan of mock debates&#8221; because &#8220;he can get bored,&#8221; has decided&#160;to eschew&#160;traditional methods of debate preparation, instead opting to watch footage&#160;of Mrs. Clinton&#8217;s best and worst debate moments to look for vulnerabilities. When asked about Trump&#8217;s preparation for the debates, Priebus didn&#8217;t appear to be concerned about how Trump&#160;would perform at the debates,&#160;&#8220;He&#8217;s very comfortable,&#8221; Priebus said. &#8220;He did a great job in our primary debates.&#160;He will be prepared. He&#8217;s always shown up for the big dance.&#8221; Although Blitzer attempted to press&#160;Priebus for&#160;more specific details on how Trump is preparing for the debate, the RNC chair would not budge, saying he &#8220;didn&#8217;t want to get into all those details,&#8221; and changing the conversation to&#160;discuss the&#160;Clinton campaign instead. The Trump-Clinton&#160;debate will be&#160;at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY Monday night at 9:00 PM EST and will be broadcast across all the major networks. It is expected to be the most&#160;viewed television debate&#160;of all time, and could reach up to&#160;100 million viewers, almost certainly affecting the outcome of the November election. Donald Trump made a name for himself in the fact-free zones that were the Republican primary debates, where a group of neocons, corporate shills, and religious extremists argued over who was willing to murder more Middle Eastern people and who hated government the most. Trump thrived by being a bully, making fun of his opponents and literally talking about the size of his penis. He&#8217;s not going to be able to get away with that tonight.

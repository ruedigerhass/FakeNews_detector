    <mainText>So, why should a student respect a teacher, when the Left say shooting police is ok? Thus, one should not be surprised when a&#160;student fights his teacher, as this student did.  A Philadelphia high school student is facing charges after video emerged of the boy getting into a violent fight with his teacher. The fight broke out at Lincoln High School on Monday, police say. The 16-year-old boy was late to class and began arguing with his 44-year-old teacher.&#160;&#160;The confrontation soon moved out into the hallway, and developed into a fist fight. Grainy video of the bust-up quickly appeared on Facebook, filmed by other students who watched on in horror. Teachers have a tough job. The difficulty of teaching has been produced by Liberals. &#160; </mainText>

    <mainText>Caitlyn Jenner has been all over the spectrum the last few months. He even admitted to contemplating suicide. Caitlyn&#160;said he was not gay, but straight woman aren&#8217;t interested (anymore), he&#8217;s confused, he&#8217;s got buyer&#8217;s remorse on the surgery. His show is canceled. Where does he go from here? Life just hasn&#8217;t been greener on the other side for Bruce..Caitlyn&#8230;whoever he is today!  &#160; US Magazine Reports: &#8220;The 66-year-old I Am Cait star &#8212; formerly known as Bruce &#8212; told Simmons, 46, that she thought about taking her own life shortly after having her Adam&#8217;s apple surgically shaved, a part of her body she &#8220;always hated.&#8221; When a paparazzo captured shots of Jenner leaving the doctor&#8217;s office after the procedure in February 2014, the former Olympian said she nearly lost it. &#8220;I could not sleep that night. I&#8217;m up at 3 a.m. walking up and down my hallway, thinking, Damn, all this s&#8211;t is going to come out tomorrow and it&#8217;s going to be horrible,&#8221; she recounted. &#8220;And I said, &#8216;You know what? Easy way. Go in the other room. You got a gun. Let&#8217;s just end it right here.&#8217;&#8221; The TV personality &#8212; who has been open about her brush with suicide with friends and family &#8212; added that the whole experience was one of the worst moments in her life.&#8221;  &#160; It is not a rarity.&#160;David Batty in the UK Guardian wrote: A review of more than 100 international medical studies of &#8220;post-operative&#8221; transsexuals finds up to 20% regret transitioning and no conclusive evidence was found that shows gender reassignment surgery improves the lives of transsexuals, with many people remaining severely distressed and even suicidal after the operation. A staggering 41 percent of transgender people in the United States have attempted to commit suicide. 65 percent of people who&#8217;ve had cosmetic surgery,&#160;which is relatively minor body alteration, later regret the decision. So it is no wonder that Caitlyn is in this huge state of confusion.  &#160;</mainText>

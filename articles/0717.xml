This was not the Ruffling of Trump&#8217;s hair moment she was looking for.  She got owned! &#8216;I&#8217;d love to meet the person who makes your pantsuits&#8217; he said. &#8216;How does Obama like his coffee?&#8217; &#8216;I really regret doing this&#8217; she said. &#8216;Are you Down with TPP?&#8217; The sponsor break was PERFECT! Share to someone who needs a good laugh &#8230; at Hillary&#8217;s expense! </mainText>

    <mainText>Protests have erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina after another African-American man was shot and killed by police on Tuesday afternoon. The victim was reportedly disabled and was reading a book in his car when cops approached him. According to police reports, officers came across&#194;&#160;Keith Lamont Scott while they were at his apartment complex to serve a warrant to someone else. Police claim that Scott had a gun and &#226;&#128;&#156;posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers,&#226;&#128;&#157;&#194;&#160;but family and witnesses dispute that claim. A woman identifying herself as the victim&#226;&#128;&#153;s daughter, Lyric Scott, said that her father didn&#226;&#128;&#153;t have a gun, he had a book. &#226;&#128;&#156;He sits in the shade, reads his book, does his studies, and waits on his kid to get off the bus,&#226;&#128;&#157; the woman said. &#226;&#128;&#156;He didn&#226;&#128;&#153;t have no gun. He wasn&#226;&#128;&#153;t messing with nobody. All they did, them &#226;&#128;&#152;jumpout boys,&#226;&#128;&#153; them undercover detectives, they jumped out their truck, they said, &#226;&#128;&#152;Hands up he got a gun, he got a gun, pow pow pow pow.&#226;&#128;&#153; That&#226;&#128;&#153;s it.&#226;&#128;&#157; You can see her video below: Here&#226;&#128;&#153;s the man&#226;&#128;&#153;s sister. She says he did not have a gun. @CMPD says he did. @WBTV_News pic.twitter.com/JwHMixy9m7 &#226;&#128;&#148; Sarah-Blake Morgan (@SarahBlakeWBTV) September 20, 2016 Protesters poured onto the streets of Charlotte on Tuesday night, chanting &#226;&#128;&#156;Black lives matter&#226;&#128;&#157; and &#226;&#128;&#156;Hands up don&#226;&#128;&#153;t shoot.&#226;&#128;&#157; Police turned out in riot gear and have deployed tear gas to control the crowds.

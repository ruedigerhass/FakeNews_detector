    <mainText>On Monday, Congressman Lee Zeldin (R-NY) took to Twitter to use the apprehension of lead suspect in the NYC bombing investigation, Ahmad Khan Rahami, to take a shot at&#160;San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in an exceptionally clumsy attempt to connect his police recent brutality protests with terrorism,&#160;writing &#8220;You are welcome&#8221; after noting that Rahami was taken into custody:  Zeldin obviously thought&#160;the tweet would give him the final say in the matter&#160;and a chance to say he thought Kaepernick was ungrateful, but the Internet had other plans. After firing off his passive aggressive swipe at &#160;the football player, Twitter would declare open season on him and continue to to roast him after declaring his ridiculous comment the new, &#8220;Thanks, Obama.&#8221;  Like &#8220;Thanks, Obama&#8221; in which Democrats mocked how Republicans went out of their way to link extremely remote events as outcomes of President Obama&#8217;s presidency, &#8220;You&#8217;re welcome, Kaepernick&#8221; could&#160;now be used to illustrate how absurdly far the right would stretch to manufacture a situation Colin Kaepernick should be&#160;grateful&#160;for.   The tweet made it to several verified accounts, most notably reaching host of Matter of Fact TV&#8217;s Soledad O&#8217;Brien. All in all, we can probably guess this is not how Congressman Zeldin&#160;planned on this tweet&#160;working out&#160;for him. Lets hope this bully learns his humiliating lesson, and&#160;stop&#160;trying to exploit&#160;a national scare&#160;to increase his national profile.   </mainText>

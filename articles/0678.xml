The riot in Charlotte was huge and escalated quickly. You know how Keith Lamont Scott&#8217;s family has been saying he had no gun and he was holding a book? That was a lie. Watch the News Report: Now watch the Charlotte Police Chief, Kerr Putney: &#8230;the media caused all this. More than 1,000 people heard on the news that a guy holding a book was shot by police, and even though these people didn&#8217;t know the guy who was shot, they came out anyway and rioted. And yet none of what they heard was true. A man with a gun was told by police to drop his gun, and he did not comply with that request. I hate to tell you this, but that is going to get you shot every time. Not only that, but in this case &#8211; contrary to the media&#8217;s racist-white-cops narrative, it was a black cop who felt threatened and fired his weapon, and a black police chief who backed up what his officers had to do. Do #BlackCopLivesMatter? &#8230;The media&#8217;s recklessness unleashed mayhem in Charlotte, for no reason whatsoever. And these malevolent fools will pay no price for what they&#8217;ve done. Only the people who had to suffer through this chaos will be paying any price.

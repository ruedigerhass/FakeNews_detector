    <mainText>The New York Times&#160;has joined a number of other major print media publications in denouncing Donald Trump as a liar. Writers at&#160;Quartz have noted that &#8220;in at least five articles in the New York Times on Sept. 17, including the lead story in the print edition, the words &#8220;lie,&#8221; &#8220;false,&#8221; &#8220;falsely claimed&#8221; and &#8220;untrue&#8221; appeared in headlines, lead paragraphs, and top sections of the paper&#8217;s Trump coverage. Executive editor Dean Baquet&#8221; said that &#8220;I think our investigative work&#8212;see [the Sept. 17] story on Trump&#8217;s tax breaks&#8212;has always been hard hitting. But we have decided to be more direct in calling things out when a candidate actually lies&#8230;The birther issue represents, well, outright lying. And he lied over a long period. It is a real word and we will use it when warranted.&#8221; Hopefully this dramatic shift in tone will be a cue to the rest of the mainstream media to abandon their insistence on treating Trump&#8217;s statements with more legitimacy than they deserve out of a desire to remain impartial. The right-wing has been exploiting that impartiality for far too long. The Republican primary debates were filled with outright falsehoods and imaginary statistics that largely went unchallenged; and Trump&#8217;s entire campaign is based on statements which are simply untrue. But it appears that Trump&#8217;s attempt to gaslight the nation and convince us that it was actually Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton that created the &#8220;birther&#8221; myth (which is decidedly false) was the last straw for the highly respected editors at the&#160;New York Times.</mainText>

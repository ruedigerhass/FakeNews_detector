    <mainText>Terence Crutcher, 40, was shot once and killed by Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby at around 7:40 p.m. Friday. Before the fatal shooting, police&#160;received reports of an abandoned vehicle blocking a road. On Monday, the police department released aerial video of the incident. Shelby&#8217;s husband and an unidentified pilot are heard telling each other than they believe the &#8220;black dude&#8221; was dangerous and &#8220;needed to be tasered.&#8221; It was later discovered that Mr. Crutcher&#160;was unarmed. He wasn&#8217;t a danger and his arms were in the air when he was shot dead by Officer Shelby. Crutcher&#8217;s&#160;vehicle had stalled in the street and was seeking assistance. The Associated Press reports: Prosecutors in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have filed first-degree manslaughter charges against the white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man on a city street. District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler filed the charges Thursday against officer Betty Shelby, who shot and killed 40-year-old Terence Crutcher&#160;on Sept. 16. Dashcam and aerial footage of the shooting and its aftermath showed Crutcher&#160;walking away from Shelby with his arms in the air. Shelby had a stun gun on her at the time but chose not to use it and instead, opted for deadly force. BREAKING: Prosecutor announces 1st-degree manslaughter charges against Tulsa officer who fatally shot Terence Crutcher. &#8212; The Associated Press (@AP) September 22, 2016  Officer Shelby has quite a history. When applying for a job with the sheriff&#8217;s office, she described previous marijuana use. In addition, she admitted to&#160;two previous domestic-related incidents involving the courts. She told of a 1993 incident in which she and&#160;her boyfriend at the time damaged each other&#8217;s vehicles when they were breaking up. Both filed temporary restraining orders that were subsequently dismissed. And then there&#8217;s a 2002 incident in which she said&#160;her ex-husband&#8217;s new wife filed a protective order which claimed that Shelby made harassing phone calls to her. Later, the protective order was later denied, according to what Shelby said in her application. &#8220;The Judge saw that I was not guilty of the accusations made against me,&#8221; she stated at the time. On Monday, the department said that Shelby is on paid administrative leave. That&#8217;s the protocol for a shooting at the hands of a police officer. And today, she faces first-degree manslaughter charges. Video of the incident: If the police shooting of Terence&#160;Crutcher is acceptable to you, then you need to reevaluate your life.</mainText>

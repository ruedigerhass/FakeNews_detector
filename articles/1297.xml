    <mainText>&#8220;By the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan &#8212; I'm very proud of it.&#8221; &#8212; Donald Trump Donald Trump&#8217;s tax cut would actually be even larger than Ronald Reagan&#8217;s 1981 tax cut. Trump's latest revision of his tax plan is estimated to cost between $4.4 trillion and $5.9 trillion, according to the Tax Foundation, or an annual average of $440 billion annually. By comparison, Reagan's 1981 tax cuts reduced taxes by an average $200 billion annually (in 2012 dollars), according to the Treasury Department. Some of those tax cuts were later rescinded when they ballooned the deficit. George W. Bush&#8217;s 2001 tax cut had an average cost of $91.5 billion annually, according to a 2013 Treasury analysis, while his 2003 cuts cost $84 billion annually.</mainText>

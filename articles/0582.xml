    <mainText>An article by former assistant U.S. attorney Andrew C. McCarthy in National Review on Monday that is critical of Democrat Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton&#8217;s counterterrorism efforts has been censored by Twitter as being &#8220;unsafe&#8221; in their view. The article, titled &#8220;The Mulish Stupidity of Clinton-Obama Counterterrorism&#8221; when clicked on from Twitter, results in the following ominous-sounding warning:  Andrew McCarthy,&#160;who led the 1995 terrorism against &#160;Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and eleven other radical Islamic terrorists, announced the censorship in a separate post on National Review on Monday evening. In the article, McCarthy makes the point that the today&#8217;s defenders of radical Islamic terrorism &#8212; progressive leftist Democrats &#8212; sound precisely like the attorney&#8217;s representing the Islamists in the cases he prosecuted in the 90&#8217;s. &#8220;As I have previously recounted, when I prosecuted the Blind Sheikh&#8217;s terrorist cell in the mid-Nineties, the defense lawyers for the jihadists &#8211; who sounded just like today&#8217;s anti-anti-terrorist progressives &#8211; claimed that their clients had been lured into terrorist activity by U.S. government policy and by the enticements of a government informant who spouted Islam-against-the-world rhetoric. In response to this fatuous contention, we put a very simple question to the jury: &#8220;What would it take to turn you into a mass-murderer?&#8221; What policy could be so bad, what rhetorical us-against-them flourishes so inspiring, that a person would join the terrorist cause and commit acts of barbarism?&#8221; Read more of the article that Twitter doesn&#8217;t want you to read HERE.

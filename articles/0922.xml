    <mainText>Monday evening during&#160;the presidential debates, Republican presidential candidate&#160;Donald Trump doubled down on his plan to reinstate &#8220;stop-and-frisk,&#8221; using New York City&#160;as an example of how effective it was in in eradicating crime. Responding to Lester Holt assertion that &#8220;stop and frisk&#8221; was ruled unconstitutional, Donald Trump said, &#8220;No, you&#8217;re wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal.&#8221; Fact Check: Stop and Frisk is unconstitutional and was neither lawful nor effective. The program, in which police officers arbitrarily decide when to stop and question a pedestrian, then frisk them for weapons and other contraband,&#160;was found to be unlawful after evidence provided proved the&#160;NYPD engaged in patterns of unconstitutional stops that were&#160;more likely to affect African-American and Latino citizens. The program&#8217;s defenders claimed high crime rates were&#160;the reason behind the disproportionate targeting of minorities, but&#160;Jeffrey Fagan at Columbia Law School found after&#160;an investigation into the program, that &#8220;even if you control for the crime rate, the racial makeup of a precinct is a good predictor of the number of stops&#8221; police do in a particular area. &#8220;Anyone who says we know this is bringing the crime rate down is really making it up,&#8221; Fagan says. Others wouldn&#8217;t put it that harshly, but the evidence does seem to suggest that stop and frisk is, at best, ineffective, and, at worst, purposefully&#160;targets&#160;communities illegally.  &#160; Examining&#160;the number of police stops per&#160;seizures of illicit goods mapped out by race, it becomes blatantly obvious that not only are African-Americans stopped over 5x more than whites, the disproportionate targeting is ineffective in reducing crime further because it ignores&#160;that the numbers suggest there would be more illicit good seizures if police attention was concentrated more appropriately in groups with a lower stop-per-seizure. Moreover, as foreign correspondent for NBC News Katy Tur live-tweeted during the debate,&#160;the murder rate in New York City did not drop until after stop-and-frisk was declared unconstitutional and stopped, it also has not risen beyond a level&#160;of concern. &#160; </mainText>

    <mainText>According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don&#8217;t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities. Case in point. The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child&#8217;s genitals, so if you&#8217;re a parent of a child and you&#8217;ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you&#8217;re a felon. For real. This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from &#8220;intentionally or knowingly touching&#8221; the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don&#8217;t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids. The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that &#8220;prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.&#8221; They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right? In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y&#8217;all. There&#8217;s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them. Wow. There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here&#8217;s an especially interesting tidbit: As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority&#8217;s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court&#8217;s help, Arizona&#8217;s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver&#8212;out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state&#8217;s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona&#8217;s parents and caregivers. Yikes. But I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y&#8217;all. Because doesn&#8217;t government always know best?</mainText>

    <mainText>Hours ahead of its face-off with Hillary Clinton on Monday night, Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign suggested that it won&#8217;t be treated fairly in the aftermath, surmising that headlines have already been written before either candidate has taken the stage. &#8220;I&#8217;m worried, Mika, about not being treated fairly afterwards. I&#8217;m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they&#8217;re conclusions in search of evidence,&#8221; Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told MSNBC&#8217;s &#8220;Morning Joe&#8221; co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough in an interview Monday morning. &#8220;You saw &#8212; and others were talking about it in the earlier segment &#8212; that this weekend was spent by editorial writers and people on Twitter and elsewhere really just trying to undercut Donald Trump before the debate.&#8221; Story Continued Below Those same people, Conway continued, are &#8220;somehow putting the burden on the media to prop up Hillary Clinton and pregame the debate,&#8221; adding, &#8220;That&#8217;s not the role of the media.&#8221; Scarborough interjected, remarking that &#8220;it&#8217;s almost like they don&#8217;t think Hillary Clinton is strong enough to do it on her own.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s the key,&#8221; Conway said. &#8220;We can scream bias and unfairness, but what Joe just said is really the key here, that they&#8217;re worried about her debating skills.&#8221; Conway, a pollster who was promoted to run the third iteration of the real estate mogul&#8217;s campaign, said despite Clinton&#8217;s participation in nearly three dozen debates, &#8220;There&#8217;s no connection that we can see between her debate performances and any type of major lift in the polls thereafter, and I think they know that over in Brooklyn.&#8221; But Trump&#8217;s biggest problem Monday night will be what Barack Obama said during his bitter 2008 primary battle against Clinton: that she&#8217;ll say anything to get elected, Conway said. &#8220;So if she ends up saying to him, &#8216;That&#8217;s just not true, you&#8217;re distorting my record, you&#8217;re being mean to a woman,&#8217; and then people will say, &#8216;He was mean to a woman,&#8217; and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up &#8212; even if it&#8217;s not true,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So that would be my concern, that he&#8217;s not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe correctly points out, people are so worried that she&#8217;s not a great debater, that she&#8217;s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she&#8217;s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.&#8221;</mainText>

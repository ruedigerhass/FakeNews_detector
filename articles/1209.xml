    <mainText>Bruce Springsteen called Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump a &#8220;moron&#8221; in an excerpt from an interview with Rolling Stone magazine published Friday. &#8220;The republic is under siege by a moron, basically. The whole thing is tragic. Without overstating it, it's a tragedy for our democracy,&#8221; the rocker said, when asked what he makes of the &#8220;Trump phenomenon&#8221;. Story Continued Below Springsteen criticized Trump&#8217;s rhetoric, saying, &#8220;The ideas he's moving to the mainstream are all very dangerous ideas &#8212; white nationalism and the alt-right movement. The outrageous things that he's done &#8212; not immediately disavowing David Duke?&#8221; Springsteen said that the things Trump has said and done would have ended any previous candidate&#8217;s campaign &#8220;immediately." &#8220;I believe that there's a price being paid for not addressing the real cost of the deindustrialization and globalization [in the U.S.],&#8221; he said, adding, &#8220;Trump's thing is simple answers to very complex problems. Fallacious answers to very complex problems. And that can be very appealing.&#8221; Springsteen also offered strong words of support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, saying, &#8220;I like Hillary. I think she would be a very, very good president.&#8221; When asked whether he&#8217;s given up on trying to impact the race, he said, &#8220;I don't know. I think you have a limited amount of impact as an entertainer, performer or musician.&#8221; However, he said he would consider getting involved with the election, adding, &#8220;I did it at the time because I felt the country was in crisis, which it certainly is right now.&#8221;</mainText>

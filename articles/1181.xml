    <mainText>If not for the presidency, Bobby Knight is pushing Donald Trump for sainthood. &#8220;I actually enjoyed the day with Saint Donald and I've enjoyed watching him. I've really enjoyed watching him, I think go about things the way that he thought things should be.,&#8221; the legendary basketball coach said Friday on &#8220;Fox &amp; Friends,&#8221; echoing a sobriquet he has begun using for the Republican nominee in recent days. &#8220;I think the man has a lot of really, really good things to bring to the table.&#8221; Story Continued Below Remarking upon Trump&#8217;s transformation as a presidential candidate, the famously hot-headed Hall of Fame coach said he was not sure if he would say the boastful businessman has become &#8220;milder.&#8221; &#8220;But I just have seen him take a different approach to how things should be and go about attacking things and what's wrong,&#8221; Knight said. &#8220;I've really been impressed with the interest that he has in seeing that things are done in the right way.&#8221; Asked whether he had discussed the ongoing unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, after police shot and killed an African-American man, Knight replied, &#8220;Not really.&#8221; &#8220;I mean that's -- you know, what is there to say?&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;It was wrong. It was&#8212;You know, you could go forever. That was not something that we really directed our attention to.&#8221; As far as what the two did discuss, Knight made note of Trump&#8217;s business records and ability to solve problems. &#8220;And that's what I think is the most important thing he brings to this job. The guy is going -- hey, this isn't working, we got to figure out what's wrong with this and we got to get this straightened out,&#8221; Knight said. &#8220;That, to me, is what being president is all about, and I don't think -- has there ever been a president that hasn't had problems?&#8221; The best president at that &#8220;might have been Reagan,&#8221; Knight said, adding, &#8220;that&#8217;s what Donald Trump brings to the table.&#8221; When it comes to Hillary Clinton&#8217;s assertion that Trump lacks the temperament to be commander in chief, Knight invoked his favorite presidents to argue the opposite. &#8220;Well, I think that being pretty strong willed is a pretty good asset to have,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I mean, who had -- has there ever been a president that was better than Harry Truman and Harry Truman had a damn good temperament.&#8221;</mainText>

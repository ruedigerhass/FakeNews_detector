    <mainText>Gary Johnson said a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump presidency would be deeply flawed and shrugged off the notion that he could play spoiler in a tight presidential contest, despite fears among Democrats, in particular, that he&#8217;s snatching votes from Clinton. &#8220;The people voting for me are voting for Gary Johnson,&#8221; the Libertarian presidential contender said Sunday on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;This Week,&#8221; with George Stephanopoulos. &#8220;I take great pride in the fact that I am actually offering an alternative. &#8230; Fifty percent of people that are registering to vote are registering as independents. How is it that we can only have two candidates?&#8221; Story Continued Below &#8220;I&#8217;m going to sleep well at the end of all this, giving people a first vote, not a second vote, not a lesser of two evils.&#8221; Clinton&#8217;s campaign manager, Robby Mook, who spoke earlier on the same program, shrugged off Johnson&#8217;s impact on the race. &#8220;He&#8217;s taking votes from both candidates, but your own poll showed that his numbers are &#8212; are dropping,&#8221; he said, referring to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll that showed Johnson dipping to 5 percent support. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that they&#8217;re &#8212; that either of the third-party candidates are really going to factor into the head-to-head in this race.&#8221;</mainText>

    <mainText>Hillary Clinton on Tuesday dismissed Donald Trump&#8217;s conspiracy theory that his microphone was tampered with ahead of Monday&#8217;s presidential debate, framing his excuse as a signal that he had a bad night in what was effectively a rhetorical mic drop. The Republican presidential nominee told &#8220;Fox and Friends&#8221; in a phone interview Tuesday morning that he was having problems with his microphone Monday night. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose?&#8221; Trump said.

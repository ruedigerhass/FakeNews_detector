    <mainText>Presidential debate moderator Lester Holt pulled two Candy Crowleys, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday, accusing of the &#8220;NBC Nightly News&#8221; anchor of mirroring Crowley&#8217;s infamous Mitt Romney fact-check twice on Monday night. In an interview with &#8220;Fox and Friends,&#8221; Giuliani said he watched the debate two times &#8212; once live, &#8220;and then I went home and I watched Lester Holt do Candy Crowley at least twice.&#8221; Story Continued Below Donald Trump, who had suggested a debate without a moderator ahead of Monday&#8217;s faceoff, warned Holt last week not to be like Crowley, who interrupted Romney in 2012 after the then-Republican nominee said it took President Barack Obama 14 days to call the attack in Benghazi, Libya, an &#8220;act of terror.&#8221; (PolitiFact rated Romney&#8217;s criticism &#8220;half true,&#8221; noting that Obama did say &#8220;act of terror&#8221; right after the attacks but that the administration did not speak &#8220;consistently in the days that followed.") Giuliani took issue with Holt &#8220;ignorantly&#8221; attempting to fact-check Trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and the real estate mogul's false assertion that he never supported the Iraq War. A federal judge in New York ruled the application of the practice unconstitutional, not the policy itself, as Holt suggested, Giuliani argued. &#8220;The thing that&#8217;s wrong is Lester Holt said straight out: Stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional. Lester Holt is not a lawyer,&#8221; Giuliani said. &#8220;He&#8217;s wrong. It was decided in 1959 by Earl Warren. It is still the law of the land.&#8221; The former mayor maintained that &#8220;every cop does stop-and-frisk in every part of America&#8221; but gave Hillary Clinton a pass for siding with Holt &#8220;because she failed the bar exam.&#8221; &#8220;But I&#8217;m not gonna allow him to play lawyer and contradict our candidate,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;And I&#8217;d like to know: When did a moderator become a fact-checker? And if you&#8217;re gonna be a fact-checker, you better darn be right.&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;m a lawyer. I&#8217;m not a moderator who misrepresents on television,&#8221; Giuliani said, after co-Steve Doocy noted that Giuliani was fact-checking Holt. &#8220;I&#8217;m a lawyer. Am I angry about it? I thought after Candy Crowley we saw the last of it. What Holt did last night &#8212; if journalism has ethics, if it has ethics, he violated the rules of ethics. Now if you&#8217;re gonna interrupt and you&#8217;re gonna correct me in front of 100 million people, you better be right. He is dead wrong.&#8221; Giuliani continued this verbal broadside, slamming Holt for being &#8220;completely unprofessional&#8221; and &#8220;totally unethical&#8221; and suggesting that &#8220;he should have had enough energy to check the sources&#8221; regarding whether Trump supported the Iraq War. &#8220;I saw the tape, and he opposed the Iraq War before the Iraq War,&#8221; Giuliani said, despite numerous fact-checks that note Trump voiced support for the war during a 2002 interview with Howard Stern. &#8220;A hundred million last night were misled by Lester Holt and so-called lawyer Hillary Clinton,&#8221; Giuliani said.</mainText>

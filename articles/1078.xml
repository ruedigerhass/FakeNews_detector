    <mainText>The anti-Donald Trump movement is on its death bed, the Republican presidential nominee boasted on Wednesday. &#8220;You&#8217;ll hear about these Never Trumpers, who are dying. Right now they&#8217;re on respirators, OK,&#8221; Trump said in response to a question about whether he will stand firm on his commitment to naming &#8220;true constitutionalists&#8221; to the Supreme Court. Story Continued Below Trump cited an &#8220;amazing&#8221; Wall Street Journal report &#8220;about all of the support that we&#8217;re getting.&#8221; The real estate mogul appears to be referring to a story published online late Monday in which the Journal reported that billionaires Sheldon Adelson and Joe Ricketts plan to pump millions of dollars into Trump and a pro-Trump super PAC. &#8220;From lots of rich people even,&#8221; Trump said of the fresh support he&#8217;s getting. &#8220;They&#8217;re coming in. These were Never Trump, Never Trump, Never Trump and now they&#8217;re &#8212; believe me, they see lower taxes, they see cutting the regulations, they see job creation, which is so important, and it&#8217;s really been amazing.&#8221; &#8220;And one of the things that they see and that you people see,&#8221; he told the group of pastors inside a Cleveland church, &#8220;is that &#8212; and so important &#8212; the judges. So I picked 11 judges. Very, very much into the world of the Constitution because we have people that, in some cases, not &#8212; I think in all cases &#8212; will have absolutely no &#8212; the Constitution will have no bearing on their decisions, OK, if somebody else gets it. And we picked 11 and we&#8217;re adding nine more. We&#8217;re gonna have a total of 20 people and I will pick from that group of 20 people. These are 20 outstanding people.&#8221;</mainText>

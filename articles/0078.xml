    <mainText>Police escorted Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein off Hofstra University&#8217;s campus this afternoon before tonight&#8217;s first presidential debate. Authorities encountered Stein on the college campus in Hempstead, New York, and asked the third-party candidate, who has not garnered enough support to participate in the debates, to show the proper credentials, which she could not do, police said. She was &#8220;nicely escorted&#8221; off the grounds around 2:30 p.m. Eastern time, a Nassau County Police Department spokesman told ABC News. Stein tweeted about the incident, saying she was on the campus &#8220;doing an interview&#8221; when police put her and her team &#8220;in a van&#8221; and escorted them off the school&#8217;s grounds. Earlier, Stein&#8217;s campaign said she obtained a credential to go in and do interviews at the media filing center in the early afternoon.  After being escorted from Hofstra campus for doing an interview, police put us in a van which was stopped not once, but twice. #debatenight pic.twitter.com/IgQJMoCNWZ  Stein had planned to challenge her exclusion from tonight&#8217;s event by hosting a rally outside the secured perimeter of the debate hall beginning, around 5 p.m. Eastern time. She said she will be live on Twitter&#8217;s Periscope app answering the same questions as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump on the debate stage. Stein&#8217;s campaign said she will not &#8220;risk arrest&#8221; this time, because there is an outstanding warrant for her arrest over her involvement in a recent protest against a controversial pipeline project in North Dakota. Still, her campaign spokeswoman Meleiza Figueroa said they will attempt to get the &#8220;spirited demonstration &#8230; as close to the gates as possible." In 2012, Stein and her running mate were arrested outside Hofstra University when they tried entering the premises during a presidential debate between President Barack Obama and then&#8211;Republican nominee Mitt Romney.

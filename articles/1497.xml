    <mainText>Arizona's laws on child molestation are so broad that a parent changing a diaper could be prosecuted for criminal activity. That is the opinion of defense attorney Russ Richelsoph and a minority of judges on the Arizona Supreme Court, according to The Arizona Republic. Child molestation in Arizona is defined as intentionally or knowingly engaging in sexual contact with a child under the age of 15. Sexual contact is interpreted as &#8220;direct or indirect touching, fondling or manipulating&#8221; of a child&#8217;s genitals or private parts. Unlike other states, the Arizona law does not require there to be an intent to harm, violate or arouse by the alleged perpetrator. In a recent ruling, the Arizona Supreme court confirmed that proving intent was not necessary. As a result, it ruled that a parent changing a diaper or a physician conducting an examination could be charged with molestation under the current interpretation of the law. &#8220;When you have a statute that criminalizes such a broad set of behaviors that everybody&#8217;s a criminal, everybody who has changed a diaper, every physician or nurse who has examined the genitals of a child, that&#8217;s a huge problem,&#8221; defense attorney Russ Richelsoph told The Republic. Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery disagreed and believes some common sense has to be observed. &#8220;I&#8217;m a parent. I have prosecutors who are parents,&#8221; Montgomery said. &#8220;We know the difference between diapering and molesting a child.&#8221; Montgomery said prosecutors handle such cases carefully. &#8220;If a defendant is going to bring that up in trial and we don&#8217;t have any evidence to show that there was sexual motivation, then juries are not going to convict, grand jurors are not going to indict,&#8221; he told KPNX. The court ruling said that changing the law was the responsibility of politicians. &#8220;We agree that the criminal code should clearly differentiate between unlawful conduct and innocent, acceptable behavior without unnecessarily broadly sweeping the latter into the former,&#8221; the court opinion stated, The Republic reported. Two judges authored a dissenting opinion. &#8220;Parents and other caregivers who have changed an infant&#8217;s soiled diaper or bathed a toddler will be surprised to learn that they have committed a class 2 or 3 felony,&#8221; the dissenting judges argued. Richelsoph described scenarios in which the legislation could be abused. &#8220;Physicians get accused of molesting children. Parents, especially in divorce situations, get accused of molesting children,&#8221; Richelsoph added. &#8220;And then you have someone spending a lot of money on a private defense attorney or having to get a public defender.&#8221; Sources: The Arizona Republic, KPNX&#160;/ Photo credit: The Arizona Republic</mainText>

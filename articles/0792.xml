    <mainText>This is a major escalation for Obama&#8217;s &#8220;JV Team.&#8221; If our men and women die from a chemical attack, it&#8217;s on Obama&#8217;s head for not taking out the terror pieces of sh-t years ago. The chemical is believed to have been a mustard agent. US troops who were in the area of the attack went through decontamination showers. Via Fox News: ISIS fighters are believed to have attacked U.S. and Iraqi forces with a chemical weapon Tuesday evening, a U.S. official told Fox News. The U.S base outside Qayyarah, 25 miles south of Mosul, came under rocket fire, and traces of a &#8220;mustard agent&#8221; were believed to be present, the official said. The attack was first reported by CNN. A Pentagon official told reporters that a &#8220;tar-like black oily substance&#8221; was found on one of the shells that landed within the base, only hundreds of yards from U.S. forces. An initial test for the agent was positive, but &#8220;could be false,&#8221; the official said. The second test was negative, possibly because the shell had been exposed to the elements. The official said the base is attacked &#8220;fairly often&#8221; with conventional weapons, but Tuesday&#8217;s assault is believed to be the first chemical attack on U.S. forces in Iraq since they returned to the country in 2014. Nearly 5,000 U.S. troops are currently on the ground in Iraq and &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of those forces are located at the base, the official said. Read more&#8230; </mainText>

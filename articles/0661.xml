    <mainText>From the Daily Caller News Foundation: Teachers at a school in Texas might be armed and are willing to use whatever force needed to protect students, according to a sign posted outside the school district. Medina Independent School District placed a sign in front of one of its entrances Sept. 14 to warn people that teachers might be armed,&#160;reports&#160;CNN. &#8220;Please be aware that the staff at Medina ISD may be armed and will use whatever force is necessary to protect our students,&#8221; the sign says. The warning serves as a good way to drive away potential threats, according to the school&#8217;s superintendent. &#8220;I think that anybody who might have a thought about harming someone in mind might think twice about it,&#8221; Superintendent Penny White&#160;said, according to KSAT 12.&#160;&#8220;We&#8217;re 20 minutes or 25 minutes from Bandera.&#160;That&#8217;s our closest law enforcement.&#8221; White and Dr. James Lindstrom, a school board member,&#160;said&#160;no specific event spurred the sign, Lindstrom added it was posted due to the &#8220;the general environment nationally.&#8221; Jillian Sides, a mother with two sons at the school, thought the sign was a good way to keep away threats. &#8220;Schools have been a target for, for lack of a better word, crazy people, and I&#8217;m perfectly fine with it,&#8221; she told KSAT. Another mother disagreed, believing the sign could bring trouble. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s asking for trouble or not. I mean, you post a sign like that, it may bring trouble, unfortunately,&#8221;&#160;said&#160;Alisha Reagan, a mother of a third-grader. White would not name the teachers, if any, who are armed. The school plans to post two additional signs at other school entrances.

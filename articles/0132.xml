    <mainText>Wouldn&#226;&#128;&#153;t it be nice if we could just kick bigots out of our country? Well, that&#226;&#128;&#153;s exactly what happened when anti-gay Arizona pastor Stephen Anderson stopped by Botswana&#194;&#160;for a visit and decided to preach hate. Anderson&#226;&#128;&#153;s road&#194;&#160; Botswana was an eventful one, with the United Kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. This forced him to find a &#226;&#128;&#156;roundabout&#226;&#128;&#157; way to get to Botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. But after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, Anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere. &#226;&#128;&#156;I have identified Steven Anderson as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa,&#226;&#128;&#157; Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba told the BBC. The country&#226;&#128;&#153;s Constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in Botswana) &#194;&#160;&#226;&#128;&#148; and if you&#226;&#128;&#153;ve ever listened to Anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech is&#194;&#160;kind of his &#226;&#128;&#152;thing.&#226;&#128;&#153; The government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a &#226;&#128;&#156;prohibited immigrant&#226;&#128;&#157;: Pastor #StevenAnderson, a #USA citizen has been declared a Prohibited Immigrant and as such is being deported from #Botswana &#226;&#128;&#148; Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) September 20, 2016  What prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be &#226;&#128;&#156;stoned to death.&#226;&#128;&#157; Anderson also repeated his praise of the Pulse nightclub shooter. While he says he doesn&#226;&#128;&#153;t advocate violence, the victims were &#226;&#128;&#156;disgusting homosexuals who the Bible says are worthy of death, the Bible says the government should put them to death, so why would I be sad if these horrible people died that the Bible says should die anyway.&#226;&#128;&#157; Anderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the Bible supports slavery, that while he doesn&#226;&#128;&#153;t believe the Bible condones slavery (it does), &#226;&#128;&#156;if it did then yes I would condone it&#226;&#128;&#157; because &#226;&#128;&#156;the Bible is always right and I am not smarter than God.&#226;&#128;&#157; In the past, Anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in France earlier this year on the country&#226;&#128;&#153;s acceptance of &#226;&#128;&#156;f*ggots,&#226;&#128;&#157;&#194;&#160;has called the Orlando massacre &#226;&#128;&#156;good news&#226;&#128;&#157; because a bunch of &#226;&#128;&#156;f*ggots&#226;&#128;&#157; died (he later expanded on that by adding that &#226;&#128;&#156;perfect Christians&#226;&#128;&#157; would &#226;&#128;&#156;bathe&#226;&#128;&#157; in the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to God), has prayed for the death of President Obama and asked God to rip out Caitlyn Jenner&#226;&#128;&#153;s heart&#194;&#160;and even suggested executing every gay person in the world &#226;&#128;&#156;to cure AIDS.&#226;&#128;&#157; You can watch Anderson getting snagged&#194;&#160;by immigration officials below. If you&#226;&#128;&#153;re anything like me, you&#226;&#128;&#153;ll play it on repeat and laugh.  You can see an interview with his camera guy here:  </mainText>

    <mainText>Well that didn&#8217;t take long. Donald trump, who had just been beaten to a bloody pulp for 90 minutes by an opponent so far out of his league it&#8217;s preposterous, did the only thing he knows how to do: Claim he was treated unfairly: Nothing on emails. Nothing on the corrupt Clinton Foundation. And nothing on #Benghazi. #Debates2016 #debatenight &#8212; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016  Poor Donald. He looked like such a petulant little child up there. His obvious case of the sniffles aside, his lack of preparation, lack of personality, lack of ability to actually compose a coherent thought and lack of any human decency came through perfectly. No, Donald. Nobody wants to listen to right-wing conspiracy theories. Secretary Clinton covered emails. The Clinton Foundation, unlike your sham charities, actually does charitable work. Please go home, have a good cry and try again October 9th. We here at Winning Democrats would like to congratulate Secretary Clinton on not just a win but a blowout.</mainText>

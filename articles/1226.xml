    <mainText>Mike Pence defended his running mate Donald Trump&#8217;s call for nationwide stop-and-frisk policies that they claim have been effective in preventing crime despite concerns it could exacerbate ties with minority communities. &#8220;It&#8217;s on a sound constitutional footing,&#8221; Pence said on "Fox News Sunday," after acknowledging that one federal court struck down the practice after statistics revealed it targeted overwhelming numbers of African-American and Hispanic residents in New York. Story Continued Below The Indiana governor, describing an &#8220;avalanche of violence&#8221; wracking Chicago, said the policy gives police authority to search those &#8220;they think may be involved or about to be involved in criminal activity.&#8221; Pence sidestepped a question about Trump&#8217;s claim that lax vetting of immigrants somehow contributed to last weekend&#8217;s terrorist attacks in Minnesota, New York and New Jersey. The attackers implicated in those incidents were both admitted to the United States as children. Pence didn&#8217;t say how tougher vetting would have helped prevent those attacks, but he said: &#8220;We need common sense back in our immigration policies.&#8221; Pence also referenced a Turkish immigrant implicated in a Friday shooting north of Seattle that left five dead as he made his call for changes in immigration policy. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know the motivation of the permanent legal resident in Washington state who took five American lives last night,&#8221; he said.</mainText>

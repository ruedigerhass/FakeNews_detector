    <mainText>How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he&#8217;s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs. Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He&#8217;s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He&#8217;s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He&#8217;s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to &#8220;relax&#8221; he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally. It&#8217;s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he&#8217;s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he&#8217;s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump&#8217;s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it&#8217;s just gibberish: Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! &#8212; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016  Just&#8230;what is he talking about? If you&#8217;re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you&#160;talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina. Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He&#8217;s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train. Featured image from file</mainText>
